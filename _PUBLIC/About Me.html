<h1>(More) About Me</h1>
<p>Hello guys, I'm Imadur Rozan Sylvano, I was previously working as an Architect, but I am currently shifting my career to be 
    a web developer, programmer, and UI UX Designer. The reason of why I am shifting my career, is because if you want to get rich, 
    don't be an Architect (in Indonesia), unless you want to get sick very often and die young, be an Architect then. I've been there, trust me. 
  It was a hell of experience, even in the office where it used to be our dream work place (back then in the university), until you taste it yourself. 
  Imagine, applying to the Architect firm you used to praise and idolize so much, as an intern, and then you realize, oh you are not getting paid at-all. 
  You just get a certificate instead, can the certificate feed your stomach for the 6 month of unpaid training? Sure can, if you are some kind of herbivore.
  Oh, where were we?</p>
  
  <p>Right, back to the topic, will being an Architect makes you rich? Yes, it can, but nowadays it seems impossible, unless you 
    are born very rich so you can ask your parents to build the office for you, ask for a project to be built (ask your dad friend's to become the client if possible), then repeat. Or you can also get rich being an Architect by corrupting the project money, in this way, not only you will get rich, but you will also became famous as 
  you thrown in the jail.</p>
  
  <p>Yes, I got to admit that my ideal dream in the past was to become the greatest Architect in Indonesia. And that is basically almost every 
    Architecture student's dream, not just me (or am I the only one?), until life hit you with a reality brick in the face, and your idealism is slowly fading away, and evolving
     into realistic as the electric bill starts ringing every night, then you have family to take care of, buying house, getting married, etc.</p>
  
  <p>Once, I have read somewhere else on the internet that if you want to get rich, work smarter, not harder, I think that is true and I 100% agree. And I am trying 
    to make a smart decision by not becoming Architect to get rich, besides took you so long, you'll probably die earlier before getting rich, even if you managed to get rich,
    you'll already 70-80 years old waiting for your own grave to come to you, just like most famous Architect. You got the money, the time, but you are old, and don't have much energy left, 
    will you be able to enjoy your money by that time, no? Most of your friends prolly have died at that point. But, does it mean you have to be programmer, as the only way to get rich? No, 
    I am not saying you to become a programmer, or to be an A, B, C, or D. You can be anything you want that you think can help you get rich faster, ngepet? Go ahead. Tuyul? Go ahead. Maling? Go to jail.
    After that, try looking into the future, what are the most demanding project right now? What are the projects that can survive mostly and sustained during pandemic? And finally, what kind of talent do we have 
    or passion that you can use and turned them to produce money? You gotta start asking yourself.</p>
  
  <p>I know, I know, every field has its own pros and cons, and mastering any field isn't any easier either. But hey, at least by being a progammer, I would not 
    put anyone else's life in danger, unless I am creating a mass destruction program like Skynet in Terminator. Because if you work as an Architect, not only that you are going to do the 24/7 
  and 9 to 9 workload (and unrealistic deadline, and revisions), you gotta be super duper careful with your CAD drawing plan, even just a few milimeters or centimeters difference can cost you a huge problem in the construction phase, 
  even worse, if you are teaming up with unrealiable civil engineer and eventually pass the drawing checking and goes to be built, it's just a matter of time before the building took someone's live. And even even worse, you will be thrown in the jail 
  for your mistakes that cost someone's live (and you are not getting rich yet).</p>
  
  <p>And yes, mastering any field takes time, no baby can run a marathon directly the moment they are just born. And I am trying to believe in myself and my family, 
  as well as my beloved Girlfriend who keep supporting me no matter what, despite changing my career. While it might seems controversial at first, and you start questioning yourself 
  about switching path (I felt that too) about your idealism and dream, but hey at least I did not regret at all about my educational background and being an ex Architect, 
  as it trained the way you think and see the world in different perspective (except bird eye view, unless you are peteronadon), something that I probably might not have if I never went to Architecture collage.</p>
  
  <p>At the end of the day, as Master Oogway once said: "Yesterday is History, Tomorrow is mystery, but today is a gift.." We will never know what will happened in the future, 
    and I'll keep be the best version of myself and keep improving.</p>
  
    <p>And this first noob looking website will be marking my journey to the financial freedom, until then..</p>
